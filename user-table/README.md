# User Table

This app will pull random user data from an API and display it in a table.

The table that will allow sorting when clicking on a header element.

When the user clicks a column header, it will sort the content in ascending order. If the same column header is clicked, it will sort it in descending order.

When the user clicks on a row, it will trigger a modal that shows some additional information for that user.
